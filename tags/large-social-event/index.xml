abstract: In this study, Call Detail Records (CDRs), covering Budapest, for the month of June in 2016 has been analyzed. During this observation period, the 2016 UEFA European Football Championship took place, which affected significantly the habit of the residents, despite the fact that not a single match was played in the city. We evaluated the fans&amp;rsquo; behavior in Budapest, during and after the Hungarian matches, and found that the mobile phone network activity reflects the football fans&amp;rsquo; behavior, demonstrating the potential of mobile phone network data within a social sensing system.</description></item></channel></rss>
