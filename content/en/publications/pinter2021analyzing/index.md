**abstract**: In this study, Call Detail Records (CDRs), covering Budapest, for the month of June in 2016 has been analyzed. During this observation period, the 2016 UEFA European Football Championship took place, which affected significantly the habit of the residents, despite the fact that not a single match was played in the city. We evaluated the fans' behavior in Budapest, during and after the Hungarian matches, and found that the mobile phone network activity reflects the football fans' behavior, demonstrating the potential of mobile phone network data within a social sensing system. The Call Detail Records are enriched with mobile phone properties to analyze the subscribers' devices. Applying the device information (Type Allocation Code) from the activity records, the Subscriber Identity Modules, that do not operate in cell phones are omitted from mobility analyses, allowing to focus on people. The mobile phone price is proposed and evaluated as a socioeconomic indicator, and correlation between the phone price and the mobility customs have been found. We also found that, beside the cell phone price, the subscriber age and the subscription type also have an effect on the mobility. On the other hand, these do not seem to affect the interest in football.
