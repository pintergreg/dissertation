## Declaration

I hereby state and declare that this Ph.D. thesis represents my own work and is the result of my own original research. I only used the sources listed in the references. All parts taken from other works, either as word for word citation or rewritten keeping the original meaning, have been unambiguously marked, and reference to the source was included.

## Acknowledgement

I would like to express my gratitude Gábor Bognár, who practically established the mobile network data processing at Óbuda University. I have learned a lot from him in regard to how to process data of this order of magnitude. The design of my Call Detail Record processing framework has been influenced by his work. I also would like to thank my supervisor for his support.

Furthermore, I am grateful to the anonymous peer reviewers, who reviewed my papers and improved my research articles through their remarks and, indirectly, this dissertation as well.

Finally, I am deeply grateful to my family and friends for their love, support, and encouragement to finish this work.
