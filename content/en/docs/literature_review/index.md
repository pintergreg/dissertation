Understanding human movements and recognizing behavior patterns that occur during daily life in urban areas requires a systematic analysis of that human mobility. The evaluation of human travel is based on observations on the individual and group levels. In the last decades, several novel datasets, based on vehicular <span class="acronym" title="Global Positioning System">GPS</span> and cellular network records or social media information, became available, which provided more accurate and sophisticated characterization of people's movements. This chapter provides a brief introduction to this field. Figure <a href="/docs/literature_review#fig:citations">2.1</a>, shows the distribution of the referenced papers from the last two decades.

## Mobile Network Data {#sec:mobile_network_data}

The mobile phone network, during its operation, constantly communicates with the cell phones. This communication can be divided into two categories: (i) the passive, cell-switching communication that keeps the cell phones ready to use the mobile phone network at any time, and (ii) the active, billed usage of the mobile phone network, including phone calls, text messages or mobile internet usage. The Call Detail Records (<span class="acronym" title="Call Detail Record">CDR</span>) collect the latter, containing information about the subscriber, the time of the activity, and the place (via the cell), where the activity occurred.

Strictly speaking, Call Detail Record (CDR) contains only call information, and the expression eXtended Detail Record (XDR) is used to denote other types of billed communication (i.e., mobile internet traffic). As <span class="acronym" title="Call Detail Record">CDR</span>s are generated only when a user makes or receives a call, its temporal resolution is low. In that sense, <span class="acronym" title="eXtended Detail Record">XDR</span>s has a higher resolution since it is a mixture of human- and device-triggered communication [<a href="/docs/bibliography#pappalardo2021evaluation" title="L. Pappalardo, L. Ferres, M. Sacasa, C. Cattuto, and L. Bravo, “Evaluation of home detection algorithms on mobile phone data using individual-level ground truth,” EPJ data science, vol. 10, no. 1, p. 29, 2021.">16</a>]. An application can request data transfer without human interaction, downloading e-mails, for example. Note that, within this work, the expression <span class="acronym" title="Call Detail Record">CDR</span> is also used to denote <span class="acronym" title="eXtended Detail Record">XDR</span>, as the obtained data does not contain any information regarding the activity type (see Chapter <a href="/docs/data_sources">Data Sources</a> for details).

The so-called passive communication (also referred to as Control Plane Record (CPR)) is network-triggered at cell-switching, or, for example, when the network status of the cellphone is monitored [<a href="/docs/bibliography#pappalardo2021evaluation" title="L. Pappalardo, L. Ferres, M. Sacasa, C. Cattuto, and L. Bravo, “Evaluation of home detection algorithms on mobile phone data using individual-level ground truth,” EPJ data science, vol. 10, no. 1, p. 29, 2021.">16</a>]. Both the active and the passive communication have the same geographical resolution, as associated with the same base stations or cells that are supposed to be more or less constant. However, the temporal granularity of the passive communication can be significantly finer.

## Mobility Indicators {#sec:mobility_indicators}

There are some indicators that are widely used in the literature to characterize human mobility, like Radius of Gyration, Entropy, or the distance between Home and the Work locations (Section <a href="/docs/data_processing_framework#sec:work_home">Home and Work Locations</a>). These indicators are determined for every subscriber.

### Radius of Gyration {#sec:gyration}

The Radius of Gyration [<a href="/docs/bibliography#gonzalez2008understanding" title="M. C. Gonzalez, C. A. Hidalgo, and A.-L. Barabasi, “Understanding individual human mobility patterns,” nature, vol. 453, no. 7196, p. 779, 2008.">17</a>] defines a circle where an individual can usually be found. It was originally defined in (<a href="#eq__gyration">1</a>), where $L$ is the set of locations visited by the individual, $r_{cm}$ is the center of mass of these locations, and $N$ is the total number of visits of time spent at these locations. The $r_i$ is the coordinate of location $i$, and $n_i$ is the number of visits or the time spent at location $i$ [<a href="/docs/bibliography#pappalardo2015returners" title="L. Pappalardo, F. Simini, S. Rinzivillo, D. Pedreschi, F. Giannotti, and A.-L. Barabási, “Returners and explorers dichotomy in human mobility,” Nature communications, vol. 6, p. 8166, 2015.">5</a>]. <a id="eq__gyration">$$\tag{1}
    r_g = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i \in L}{n_i (r_i - r_{cm})^2}}$$

### K-Radius of Gyration {#sec:k_gyration}

The K-radius of Gyration is calculated using only the $k$ most frequent locations of the individual [<a href="/docs/bibliography#pappalardo2015returners" title="L. Pappalardo, F. Simini, S. Rinzivillo, D. Pedreschi, F. Giannotti, and A.-L. Barabási, “Returners and explorers dichotomy in human mobility,” Nature communications, vol. 6, p. 8166, 2015.">5</a>], defined by (<a href="#eq__k_gyration">2</a>). Pappalardo et al, used this approach to classify individuals by their mobility customs. Two classes named "Returners" and "Explorers" have been defined by the value of gyration. Returners are who spend most of their time between the $k$ most frequent locations ($r_g^{(2)} > r_g / 2$), in contrast to the explorers whose activity area cannot be described with the $k$ most frequent locations ($r_g^{(2)} < r_g / 2$) [<a href="/docs/bibliography#xu2018human" title="Y. Xu, A. Belyi, I. Bojic, and C. Ratti, “Human mobility and socioeconomic status: Analysis of Singapore and Boston,” Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, vol. 72, pp. 51–67, 2018.">10</a>]. <a id="eq__k_gyration">$$\tag{2}
    r_g^{(k)} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_k} \sum_{i = 1}^{k}{n_i (r_i - r_{cm}^{(k)})^2}}$$

### Number of Activity Locations {#sec:number_of_activity_locations}

The number of activity locations (<a href="#eq__number_of_activity_locations">3</a>) is simply the number of the visited cells during an observation period, defined by Xu et al. in [<a href="/docs/bibliography#xu2018human" title="Y. Xu, A. Belyi, I. Bojic, and C. Ratti, “Human mobility and socioeconomic status: Analysis of Singapore and Boston,” Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, vol. 72, pp. 51–67, 2018.">10</a>].

<a id="eq__number_of_activity_locations">$$\tag{3}
    A = \left|(s_1, s_2, ..., s_n)\right|$$

### Mobility Entropy {#sec:entropy}

The mobility entropy (or mobility diversity) of the visited locations characterizes the diversity of the individual's movements, defined as Equation (<a href="#eq__entropy">4</a>), where $L$ is the set of locations visited by the individual, $l$ represents a single location, $p(l)$ is the probability of an individual being active at a location $l$ and $N$ is the total number of activities for an individual [<a href="/docs/bibliography#pappalardo2016analytical" title="L. Pappalardo, M. Vanhoof, L. Gabrielli, Z. Smoreda, D. Pedreschi, and F. Giannotti, “An analytical framework to nowcast well-being using mobile phone data,” International Journal of Data Science and Analytics, vol. 2, no. 1-2, pp. 75–92, 2016.">18</a>, <a href="/docs/bibliography#cottineau2019mobile" title="C. Cottineau and M. Vanhoof, “Mobile phone indicators and their relation to the socioeconomic organisation of cities,” ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, vol. 8, no. 1, p. 19, 2019.">19</a>]. <a id="eq__entropy">$$\tag{4}
    MD = - \frac{\sum_{l \in L}{p(l) \log p(l)}}{\log N}$$

The generalization of the Mobility Entropy is the term, Travel Diversity [<a href="/docs/bibliography#xu2018human" title="Y. Xu, A. Belyi, I. Bojic, and C. Ratti, “Human mobility and socioeconomic status: Analysis of Singapore and Boston,” Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, vol. 72, pp. 51–67, 2018.">10</a>]. Instead of the diversity of the locations, it determines the diversity of the travels between consecutive locations. It can be calculated to $k$-length transitions, where $k=1$ gives back the location entropy. It is possible to consider the transitions with or without direction, contingent on whether the difference between $L_1 \rightarrow L_2$ and $L_2 \rightarrow L_1$ is important or not.

## Social Sensing {#sec:social_sensing}

<span class="acronym" title="Call Detail Record">CDR</span> processing is often applied for large social event detection, such as football matches [<a href="/docs/bibliography#traag2011social" title="V.

Morlot, “Social event detection in massive mobile phone data using probabilistic location inference,” in 2011 IEEE Third International Conference on Privacy, Security, Risk and Trust and 2011 IEEE Third International Conference on Social Computing, 2011, pp. 625–628.">20</a>, <a href="/docs/bibliography#xavier2012analyzing" title="F.

Rotman and M. Shalev, “Using Location Data from Mobile Phones to Study Participation in Mass Protests,” Sociological Methods & Research, p. 0049124120914926, 2020.">27</a>]. When thousands of people are in the same place at the same time, they generate a significant "anomaly" in the data, whereas small groups usually do not stand out from the "noise". This is especially true when the passive, transparent communication between the mobile phone device and the cell is not included in the data, but only the active communication (voice calls, text messages, and data transfer) is recorded.

Wirz et al. estimated the crowd density during Lord Mayor's Show 2011 in London [<a href="/docs/bibliography#wirz2013probing" title="M. Wirz, T. Franke, D. Roggen, E. Mitleton-Kelly, P.

Xavier et al. compared the reported number of attendees of these events with the detected ones. Furletti et al. also analyzed sociopolitical events, football matches, and concerts in Rome [<a href="/docs/bibliography#furletti2017discovering" title="B. Furletti, R. Trasarti, P. Cintia, and L.

## COVID-19 {#sec:covid19}

The data used in this work predates the COVID-19 pandemic and solely focuses on the "normal" life of Budapest.

Epidemiology is used to be mentioned as a potential application of human mobility studies, with some applications like [<a href="/docs/bibliography#brdar2016unveiling" title="S. Brdar, K. Gavrić, D. Ćulibrk, and V. Crnojević, “Unveiling spatial epidemiology of HIV with mobile phone data,” Scientific reports, vol. 6, no. 1, pp. 1–13, 2016.">33</a>], but the COVID-19 pandemic prioritized its applications in Digital Epidemiology, as mobile phone network data can reflect the mobility changes caused by the imposed restrictions. The term "Digital Epidemiology" can be used when working with data that was not generated with the primary purpose of epidemiological studies [<a href="/docs/bibliography#salathe2018digital" title="M. Salathé, “Digital epidemiology: what is it, and where is it going?,” Life sciences, society and policy, vol. 14, no. 1, pp. 1–5, 2018.">34</a>], that had considerable applications even before the COVID-19 pandemic [<a href="/docs/bibliography#park2018digital" title="H.-A. Park, H. Jung, J. On, S. K. Park, and H. Kang, “Digital epidemiology: use of digital data collected for non-epidemiological purposes in epidemiological studies,” Healthcare informatics research, vol. 24, no. 4, p. 253, 2018.">35</a>]. Mobile network data is also utilized to analyze human mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effectiveness of the restrictions.

Willberg et al. identified a significant decrease in the population presence in the largest cities of Finland after the lockdown compared to a usual week [<a href="/docs/bibliography#willberg2021escaping" title="E. Willberg, O. Järv, T. Väisänen, and T. Toivonen, “Escaping from cities during the covid-19 crisis: Using mobile phone data to trace mobility in finland,” ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, vol. 10, no. 2, p. 103, 2021.">36</a>]. Romanillos et al. reported similar results from the Madrid metropolitan area [<a href="/docs/bibliography#romanillos2021city" title="G. Romanillos et al., “The city turned off: Urban dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic based on mobile phone data,” Applied Geography, vol. 134, p. 102524, 2021.">37</a>]. W. D. Lee et al. examined the effect of the <span class="acronym" title="Social Economic Status">SES</span> on the mobility changes during the lockdown and found that the mobility of the wealthier subscribers decreased more significantly in England [<a href="/docs/bibliography#do2021association" title="W. Do Lee, M. Qian, and T. Schwanen, “The association between socioeconomic status and mobility reductions in the early stage of England’s COVID-19 epidemic,” Health & Place, p. 102563, 2021.">38</a>]. This is in good agreement with [<a href="/docs/bibliography#yechezkel2021human" title="M. Yechezkel, A. Weiss, I. Rejwan, E. Shahmoon, S. Ben-Gal, and D. Yamin, “Human mobility and poverty as key drivers of COVID-19 transmission and control,” BMC public health, vol. 21, no. 1, pp. 1–13, 2021.">39</a>], where Yechezkel et al. found that poorer regions of Israel showed lower and slower compliance with the mobility restrictions.

Labrinidis, “Effectiveness and compliance to social distancing during COVID-19,” arXiv preprint arXiv:2006.12720, 2020.">41</a>]. Yabe et al. found that one week into the state of emergency, human mobility behavior decreased by around 50%, resulting in a 70% reduction of social contacts in Tokyo [<a href="/docs/bibliography#yabe2020non" title="T. Yabe, K. Tsubouchi, N. Fujiwara, T. Wada, Y. Sekimoto, and S. V. Ukkusuri, “Non-compulsory measures sufficiently reduced human mobility in Tokyo during the COVID-19 epidemic,” Scientific reports, vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 1–9, 2020.">46</a>]. This also confirms that mobile network data analysis is an efficient tool to monitor the effect of restrictions, just as Google Mobility data [<a href="/docs/bibliography#sadowski2021big" title="A. Sadowski, Z. Galar, R. Walasek, G. Zimon, and P. Engelseth, “Big data insight on global mobility during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdown,” Journal of big Data, vol. 8, no. 1, pp. 1–33, 2021.">47</a>].

Still, these analyses might not be common enough. Oliver et al. asked: "Why is the use of mobile phone data not widespread, or a standard, in tackling epidemics?" [<a href="/docs/bibliography#oliver2020mobile" title="N. Oliver et al., “Mobile phone data for informing public health actions across the COVID-19 pandemic life cycle.” American Association for the Advancement of Science, 2020.">48</a>]. This, however, is not within the scope of this study.

## Selecting the Subscribers

Csáji et al. took into account subscribers who had at least ten activities during the observation period (15 months) [<a href="/docs/bibliography#csaji2013exploring" title="B. C. Csáji et al., “Exploring the mobility of mobile phone users,” Physica A: statistical mechanics and its applications, vol. 392, no. 6, pp. 1459–1473, 2013.">49</a>]. Xu et al. chose to use those subscribers who had at least one activity record on at least half of the days during the observation period [<a href="/docs/bibliography#xu2018human" title="Y. Xu, A. Belyi, I. Bojic, and C. Ratti, “Human mobility and socioeconomic status: Analysis of Singapore and Boston,” Computers, Environment and Urban Systems, vol. 72, pp. 51–67, 2018.">10</a>]. Pappalardo et al. discarded the subscribers who had only one location, and the individuals have at least half as many calls as hours are in the data set. Furthermore, the abnormally active (more than 300 calls per day) <span class="acronym" title="Subscriber Identity Module">SIM</span> cards are excluded [<a href="/docs/bibliography#pappalardo2015returners" title="L. Pappalardo, F. Simini, S. Rinzivillo, D. Pedreschi, F. Giannotti, and A.-L. Barabási, “Returners and explorers dichotomy in human mobility,” Nature communications, vol. 6, p. 8166, 2015.">5</a>]. I selected the <span class="acronym" title="Subscriber Identity Module">SIM</span> cards that have activity for at least 20 days (out of 30), the daily mean activity number is at least 40 on workdays and at least 20 on weekends, but not more than 1000. The upper limit is especially important to remove <span class="acronym" title="Subscriber Identity Module">SIM</span> cards that possibly operate in mobile broadband modems, for example. More details in Section <a href="/docs/data_processing_framework#sec:selecting_active_sims">Selecting Active SIMs</a>. Filtering by activity is not necessarily sufficient to keep only individuals in the data set. Type Allocation Codes (<span class="acronym" title="Type Allocation Code">TAC</span>), on the other hand, can determine the type of the device and the exact model of a cell phone (Section <a href="/docs/data_sources#sec:device_types">Device Types</a>).

## Commuting

Identifying the home and work locations of a subscriber is a common and crucial part of the <span class="acronym" title="Call Detail Record">CDR</span> processing, as a good portion of the people live their lives in an area that is determined by only their home and workplace [<a href="/docs/bibliography#pappalardo2015returners" title="L. Pappalardo, F. Simini, S. Rinzivillo, D. Pedreschi, F. Giannotti, and A.-L. Barabási, “Returners and explorers dichotomy in human mobility,” Nature communications, vol. 6, p. 8166, 2015.">5</a>, <a href="/docs/bibliography#jiang2017activity" title="S. Jiang, J. Ferreira, and M. C.

While in the case of returners, the radius of gyration is dominated by their movement between a few preferred locations, the explorers have a tendency to travel between a larger number of different locations. To demonstrate this dichotomy, they defined the k-radius of gyration, which refers to the gyration radius of the $k$ most frequent locations.

### Connectivity {#connectivity .unnumbered}

Traveling within a city or across cities is not necessarily bound to the home or work locations. Understanding the travel customs concerning recreational activities or tourism, for example, is also an important aspect of urban mobility.

## Socioeconomic Status {#sec:ses_literature}

The demographic metrics and Social Economic Status (SES) seem to have a significant relationship to individual travel behavior. Early studies aimed to investigate the correlation between the human travel characteristics and between <span class="acronym" title="Social Economic Status">SES</span> [<a href="/docs/bibliography#hanson1981travel" title="S.

Kwan, “Gender, the home-work link, and space-time patterns of nonemployment activities,” Economic geography, vol. 75, no. 4, pp. 370–394, 1999.">74</a>]. Utilizing mobility indicators, calculated from mobile network data, to infer <span class="acronym" title="Social Economic Status">SES</span> is a current direction of mobility analysis, as the study of city structures (for example, Aung et al. classified land use types based on mobile network activity [<a href="/docs/bibliography#aung2019identification" title="T. AUNG, K. K. LWIN, Y. SEKIMOTO, and others, “Identification and Classification of Land Use Types in Yangon City by Using Mobile Call Detail Records (CDRs) Data,” Journal of the Eastern Asia Society for Transportation Studies, vol. 13, pp. 1114–1133, 2019.">75</a>], Furno et al. fused GPS traces and mobile phone data [<a href="/docs/bibliography#furno2017fusing" title="A.

Mobile phone indicators were estimated from six months of Call Detail Records, while census and administrative data are used to characterize the socioeconomic organization of French cities. The findings show that some mobile phone indicators relate significantly to different socioeconomic organization of cities. Pokhriyal et al.

Six mobility indicators, housing prices, and income in Singapore and Boston have been used to analyze the socioeconomic classes. It was found that phone users who are generally wealthier tend to travel shorter distances in Singapore, but longer, in Boston. The research brought interesting findings but also showed that the relationship between mobility and socioeconomic status is worth investigating in other cities and countries as well.

## Visualization {#sec:gis}

Practically all the previously referenced publications use Voronoi tesselation for representing the cells of the mobile network. I also chose this method, but this does not mean that the Voronoi polygons generated around the base stations or the cell centroids give a perfect representation of the cell coverage. In the case of base stations that usually serve multiple antennas in different directions, the Voronoi polygons may be closer to the real coverage area, apart from the fact that some antennas may cover a much larger area than the others of the given base station. When the cell centroids are known (as in the case of the "April 2017" dataset of this work, Section <a href="/docs/data_sources#sec:vod201704">Vodafone April 2017</a>), the Voronoi polygons are even less ideal approximation. On the other hand, close cells are merged during the data processing (e.g., in [<a href="/docs/bibliography#fiadino2017call" title="P. Fiadino, V. Ponce-Lopez, J. Antonio, M. Torrent-Moreno, and A. D’Alconzo, “Call Detail Records for Human Mobility Studies: Taking Stock of the Situation in the’ Always Connected Era,’” in Proceedings of the Workshop on Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning for Data Communication Networks, 2017, pp. 43–48.">51</a>], or as I did). Especially after the merge, the Voronoi tesselation seemed the best available option.

When working with administrative boundaries or selecting an area to analyze, the cells can be associated by the centroid/base station coordinates or the Voronoi polygons (see Section <a href="/docs/data_processing_framework#sec:selecting_an_area">Selecting an Area</a>). Lenormand et al. used an interesting approach approximating the administrative boundaries with the Voronoi polygons of the mobile network cells [<a href="/docs/bibliography#lenormand2020entropy" title="M.

## Social Media

There are studies that try to utilize data from social media as an alternative to, or along with [<a href="/docs/bibliography#tu2017coupling" title="W. Tu et al., “Coupling mobile phone and social media data: A new approach to understanding urban functions and diurnal patterns,” International Journal of Geographical Information Science, vol. 31, no. 12, pp. 2331–2358, 2017.">102</a>], mobile network data. The before-mentioned directions are present in the social media based works. This section provides non-exhaustive examples. Galeazzi et al. geo-located Facebook data of 13 million users from France, Italy, and the UK and found that where Value Added per capita, and Population Density are high, resilience to mobility disruptions are higher [<a href="/docs/bibliography#galeazzi2021human" title="A. Galeazzi et al., “Human mobility in response to COVID-19 in France, Italy and UK,” Scientific reports, vol. 11, no. 1, pp. 1–10, 2021.">103</a>]. Shepherd et al. analyzed the mobility trends in the United Kingdom (both domestic and international) during the pandemic, based on Facebook data [<a href="/docs/bibliography#shepherd2021domestic" title="H.
